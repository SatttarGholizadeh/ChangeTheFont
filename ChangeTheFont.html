        <h1>Mount Sabalan</h1>
        <p>
            Located in the extreme northwest of Iran, Sabalan is the
             country's third-highest peak after Damavand and Alam-Kuh.
              It is also slightly higher than Mont Blanc in the Alps.

            The mountain offers many attractions throughout the year.
             On the slopes of the mountain, the mineral water from springs 
             attracts large numbers of tourists each year, many of whom have faith in
             healing properties attributed to the springs.
             The nomadic people of the area live in small villages,
             with their round "Yurt" tents appealing to tourism.
             Sabalan has a ski resort (Alvares) and different tourist
             areas such as the Sarein spa. The mountain is known for
             its beautiful vistas, including the Shirvan gorge, where 
             few climbers ever venture.

        <h1>Geology</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>
            Sabalan is a large andesite stratovolcano in Meshgin Shahr,
             in Ardabil Province in Iran. It is the second-highest volcano 
             after Mount Damavand. The volcano is quite old. Its first eruptions
              occurred in the Eocene and later in the Miocene. 
              But the main volcanism happened in the Pliocene and the
               Pleistocene as some of its rocks have been dated to 5â€“1.4  
               million years. Some references state that volcanic activity continued
                into the Holocene, less than 10,000  years ago.

            The summit region has several peaks exceeding 4,500 metres (14,800 ft),
             primarily along a southwest-northeast trending ridge. The highest point 4,791 
             metres (15,719 ft) is at the northeast end of the ridge and is separated
             from the 4,620 metres (15,160 ft)+ group of southwestern summits by a
             4,190 m (13,750 ft) col.

            The mountain is located in a continental climate with hot,
             dry summers and extremely cold, snowy winters. Precipitation 
             falls primarily as snow in late autumn, winter, and spring, and 
             is sufficient to sustain seven glaciers near the summit above
             4,000 metres (13,000 ft). The largest of these were more
             than 1.5 kilometres (1 mi) in length as of the 1970s. 
             There are also extensive rock glaciers, several of which
             are more than 3 km (2 mi) in length.
